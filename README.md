## Introduction

This project is a simple search engine that mimics the Google search engine.

The Google search engine is a very complex system, but I tried to make it as simple as possible. The app is based on a JSON file that contains the data of simple articles that are displayed on the page. The search engine must be able to search for articles by title, description, and content.

Cases that the search engine must be able to handle:

- Search for articles by title, description, and content.
- Use search operators to filter the results, like exact match, or, and, not, etc.
- Register the number of results found.
- Register the time it took to perform the search.
